# Athena Achievements

> **Bundled with Athena Agent.** Originally authored by [@PCinkusz](https://github.com/PCinkusz) at https://github.com/PCinkusz/athena-achievements — vendored into `plugins/athena-achievements/` so it ships with the dashboard out-of-the-box and stays in lockstep with Athena feature changes. Upstream repo remains the staging ground for new badges and UI iteration.
>
> When Athena is installed via `pip install athena-agent` or cloned from source, this plugin auto-registers as a dashboard tab on first `athena dashboard` launch. No separate install step. See [Built-in Plugins → athena-achievements](../../website/docs/user-guide/features/built-in-plugins.md) in the main docs.

Achievement system for the Athena Dashboard: collectible, tiered badges generated from real local Athena session history.

The screenshots use temporary demo tier data to show the full visual range. The plugin itself reads real local Athena session history by default.

> **Update notice (2026-04-29):** If you installed this plugin before today, update to the latest version. The achievements scan path was refactored for much faster warm loads (snapshot cache + incremental checkpoint scan).
>
> **Share cards (2026-05-04, vendored in athena-agent v0.4.0):** Unlocked achievement cards now have a "Share" button that renders a 1200×630 PNG share card (client-side canvas, no backend, no network) with Download + Copy-to-clipboard actions. Fits X/Twitter, Discord, LinkedIn, Bluesky link-preview dimensions.

## What it does

Athena Achievements scans local Athena sessions and unlocks badges based on real agent behavior:

- autonomous tool chains
- debugging and recovery patterns
- vibe-coding file edits
- Athena-native skills, memory, cron, and plugin usage
- web research and browser automation
- model/provider workflows
- lifestyle patterns such as weekend or night sessions

Achievements have three visible states:

- **Unlocked** — earned at least one tier
- **Discovered** — known achievement, progress visible, not earned yet
- **Secret** — hidden until Athena detects the first related signal

Most achievements level through:

```text
Copper → Silver → Gold → Diamond → Olympian
```

Each card has a collapsible **What counts** section showing the exact tracked metric or requirement once the user wants details.

Version `0.2.x` expands the catalog to 60+ achievements, including model/provider badges such as **Five-Model Flight**, **Provider Polyglot**, **Claude Confidant**, **Gemini Cartographer**, and **Open Weights Pilgrim**.

## Examples

- Let Him Cook
- Toolchain Maxxer
- Red Text Connoisseur
- Port 3000 Is Taken
- This Was Supposed To Be Quick
- One More Small Change
- Skillsmith
- Memory Keeper
- Context Dragon
- Plugin Goblin
- Rabbit Hole Certified

## Install

Clone into your Athena plugins directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PCinkusz/athena-achievements ~/.athena/plugins/athena-achievements
```

For local development, keep the repo elsewhere and symlink it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PCinkusz/athena-achievements ~/athena-achievements
ln -s ~/athena-achievements ~/.athena/plugins/athena-achievements
```

Then rescan dashboard plugins:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:9119/api/dashboard/plugins/rescan
```

When installed as a user plugin, the dashboard UI loads but Python backend API
routes are not auto-imported. Backend routes are available when this plugin is
bundled with Athena.

## Updating

If you installed with git:

```bash
cd ~/.athena/plugins/athena-achievements
git pull --ff-only
curl http://127.0.0.1:9119/api/dashboard/plugins/rescan
```

For a user-installed plugin at `~/.athena/plugins/athena-achievements`, a plugin
rescan is enough because Python backend routes are not auto-imported. If you
update the bundled plugin by pulling changes in the athena-agent repository, and
that bundled plugin update changes backend routes or `plugin_api.py`, restart
`athena dashboard` after pulling.

As of 2026-04-29, updating is strongly recommended because scan performance changed significantly:
- removed duplicate `/overview` scan path
- added cached `/achievements` snapshot
- added incremental checkpoint reuse for unchanged sessions

Achievement unlock state is stored locally in `state.json` and is not overwritten by git updates. New achievements are evaluated from your existing Athena session history. Achievement IDs are stable and should not be renamed casually because they are the unlock-state keys.

Releases are tagged in git, for example:

```bash
git fetch --tags
git checkout v0.2.0
```

## Files

```text

├── plugin_api.py
└── dist/

    └── style.css
```

## API

These backend routes are mounted for the bundled plugin. User-installed copies
load their dashboard UI but do not auto-import Python backend routes.

Routes are mounted under:

```text
/api/plugins/athena-achievements/
```

Endpoints:

```text
GET  /achievements
GET  /scan-status
GET  /recent-unlocks
GET  /sessions/{session_id}/badges
POST /rescan
POST /reset-state
```

## Development

Run checks:

```bash
node --check dashboard/dist/index.js
python3 -m py_compile dashboard/plugin_api.py
python3 -m unittest tests/test_achievement_engine.py -v
```
