# Under s6-overlay this no longer works: the bootstrap (UID remap, data-volume

# root-owned and non-writable; mutable runtime state must live under
# $ATHENA_HOME. An arbitrary `--user` UID therefore cannot repair or populate
# the data volume, and startup fails with EACCES. See #34837 for the
# supervision-tree side of this.
#
# The supported way to match host-side ownership is to start as root (the image
# default) and pass ATHENA_UID/ATHENA_GID — or the PUID/PGID aliases — which the

# the exact same outcome (files owned by your host UID) without breaking s6.
#
# preinit runs setuid-root (euid=0) but cont-init.d hooks run with the real UID
# the container was started as, so `id -u` here is the host UID (e.g. 1000), and
# `id -u athena` is the unremapped build UID (10000) because no root-only remap
# could run. root starts (id -u = 0) and the normal supervised drop to the

[stage2] ERROR: container started with --user $cur_uid (an arbitrary, non-athena UID).

This is not supported under the s6-overlay image. The container bootstrap
(UID remap, data-volume ownership, config seeding) needs to start as root,
and the baked /opt/athena install tree is intentionally root-owned and
non-writable, so a pinned --user UID cannot repair startup state — startup
will fail.

To make container-written files match your HOST user, DON'T use --user.
Start the container as root (the default) and pass your host UID/GID instead:

    docker run -e ATHENA_UID=\$(id -u) -e ATHENA_GID=\$(id -g) ...

NAS users (Synology / unRAID / UGOS) can use the PUID/PGID aliases:

    docker run -e PUID=\$(id -u) -e PGID=\$(id -g) ...

The image remaps the athena user to that UID/GID at boot and chowns the data
volume accordingly, so files land owned by your host user — the same outcome
--user was being used for, without breaking the supervision tree.

# --- Docker socket group membership (docker-in-docker / DooD) ---
# When the user bind-mounts the host Docker daemon socket
# (`-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`) to use the `docker`
# terminal backend from inside the container, the socket is owned by the
# host's `docker` group (or root). The supervised athena user (UID 10000)
# is not a member of any group that matches the socket's GID, so every
# `docker` invocation EACCES'es and `check_terminal_requirements()` fails.
# See #16703.
#
# Granting the supp group via `docker run --group-add <gid>` alone is
# NOT sufficient with our s6-setuidgid privilege drop: s6-setuidgid (and
# gosu, the older shim) calls initgroups() for the target user, which
# rebuilds the supplementary group list from /etc/group. Without an
# /etc/group entry whose GID matches the socket, the kernel-granted
# supp group is silently wiped between PID 1 and the dropped process.
# Confirmed empirically: `--group-add 998` alone leaves the dropped
# athena process with `Groups: 10000` (998 gone); after this hook adds
# the entry, the dropped process has `Groups: 998 10000` as expected.
#
# Fix: detect the socket's GID at boot and ensure /etc/group has a
# matching entry that includes athena. Idempotent across container
# restarts. Skipped silently when no socket is bind-mounted.
#
# Handles the awkward corner cases:
#   - socket owned by GID 0 (root) — some Podman setups; usermod -aG root
#   - socket GID already used by a known container group (e.g. tty=5):
#     reuse that group's name rather than creating a duplicate
#   - athena is already a member of the right group (idempotent restart)
#   - chown/groupadd failures under rootless containers — non-fatal
